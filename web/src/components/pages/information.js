                            There are several banks near campus: including BB&T and Bank of America (BOA). Usually there will be BB&T staff coming to UR and tabling at the Commons at the beginning of each school year. But students may need to use other transportation to go to BOA. There is Uber and shuttles on campus that will help you to get there.
